        If you participate in OpenGov on Polkadot and Kusama or onchain
        governance on any of their parachains, you inevitably expose your voting
        preferences to the world. While your account can be a pseudonym, all
        your actions will be linkable and eventually reveal your identity.
        Knowing this will likely affect your voting behavior and promote
        conformity, obedience and submission. Vote privacy, on the other hand,
        rather promotes creativity, exploration and dissent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 text-justify">
        Integritee will allow you to vote with enhanced privacy in web3
        governance. This will enable you to vote freely and without fear of
        repercussions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 text-justify">
        With great power comes great responsibility. For web3 governance to be
        legitimate, we need to strike a balance between privacy and
        accountability. Dominant voting power should never come with absolute
        privacy.
